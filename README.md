This project analyzes the Bank Marketing Dataset using Python and machine learning techniques to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit. The dataset is preprocessed, explored through visualization, and modeled using various classification algorithms.

ðŸ“Œ Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handling categorical variables, encoding, scaling, and feature selection.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing categorical variables and correlations.
Machine Learning Models:
Decision Tree Classifier
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
Gradient Boosting Classifier
Feature Selection: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to improve model performance.
Evaluation Metrics: F1-score and accuracy using cross-validation.
